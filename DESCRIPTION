Description: The package simulates the behavior of population genetics according to the 
    Wright-Fisher Model. It assumes a diploid population with two possible alleles.
    Using that simulation, grafics can be generated. They show the evolution of 
    different realizations from a given starting point. One focuses on the number of
    each alleles, another one on the variance between the realizations, and the third one
    the heterozygosity.
