# WrightFisherSimulation
A R-package that simulates the behavior of population genetics according to the [Wright-Fisher Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift#Wright%E2%80%93Fisher_model). It assumes a diploid population with two possible alleles. Using that simulation, grafics can be generated. They show the evolution of different realizations from a given starting point. One focuses on the number of each alleles, another one on the variance between the realizations, and the third one the heterozygosity.


## Installation
You can install the package in R via
```devtools::install_git("https://github.com/johschnee/WrightFisherSimulation.git")```.
